        College - All I can find
            Have D1 Logos, - find a generic one for smaller schools
    !!! Create a map of all the locations in the state of michigan
        need to simplify the location data to render quickly on a map 

            just grab a single point from each row 
            try making map in tableau
            use beautifulsoup to to get the coordinates of a polygon for each layer and grab the first point from that list
                this will be home plate for distance measurements and is a single point to plot fields on map
                
    
BIG PROJECTS

* figure out how to measure distances, want the min and max distance for each field
probably need to define a point to measure from - the homeplate point 
    should be pretty easy to know which point that is programatically. it should be the first point in the line string for each polygon
        all of the later plots were drawn in that manner.
