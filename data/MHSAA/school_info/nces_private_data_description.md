PSS_ENROLL_UG (UNGRADED STUDENTS)

Ungraded students are those who are not assigned to a particular grade level (kindergarten, first grade, second grade, etc.); for example special education centers and alternative schools often classify their students as ungraded. Students in Montessori schools are also considered ungraded if the school assigns them to "primary" and "intermediate" levels instead of specific grades.

PSS_FTE_TEACH

Part-time and full-time teachers were included in the computation of the full-time equivalents. The school's full-time equivalent teachers were calculated as follows:

the SUM of teachers that ...

(TAUGHT FULL-TIME) +
(TAUGHT AT LEAST 3/4 TIME BUT LESS THAN FULL-TIME * .875) +
(TAUGTT AT LEAST 1/2 TIME BUT LESS THAN 3/4 TIME * .625) +
(TAUGHT AT LEAST 1/4 TIME BUT LESS THAN 1/2 TIME * .375) +
(TAUGHT LESS THAN 1/4 TIME * .125).
