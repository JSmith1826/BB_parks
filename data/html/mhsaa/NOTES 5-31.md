## NOTES FRO MHSAA 

Tues night 5/31

Want to create a new container called mapControls that is a box with MHSAA title logo on top then under that the reset button with cycle buttons (need to add the cycling)
under that the filter by division
under that the filter by round

Need to fix the filter. If there is a round selected but then the division is selected all rounds reappear on map

Need to fix the hostInfo box. It is not working at all right now. need to load the correct JSON and then connect it to the box.

I thought I had it working at one time. i have a csv witht he games but I can't find any json. I also deleted most of the old files
