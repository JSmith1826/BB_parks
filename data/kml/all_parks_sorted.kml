Stan Galle Field is also one the more unique fields in college baseball with its location immediately next to the Administration Building. Host to numerous conference and regional baseball tournaments, the site has become a favorite spring gathering spot for students, alumni and fans of the Badger baseball program.<br><br>In 2022, Spring Hill College honored the career of former head coach Frank Sims by renaming the field to Sims-Galle Field.]]></description>

					<description>Estadio Francisco A. Micheli (formerly known as Romana, in reference to the city where it is located) is a private multipurpose stadium dedicated mainly to the sport of baseball. Located in the city of La Romana, with a capacity for about 10,000 people, is the home of the Dominican professional team Toros del Este.[1] The stadium was inaugurated in 1979 by President Antonio Guzmán Fernández and is owned by the Central Romana Corporation. In 1998 the stadium suffered damage as a result of Hurricane Georges, which went through much of the Dominican Republic during that year.</description>

From 1970 through 2020, it served as home field of the Pawtucket Red Sox (PawSox), a Minor League Baseball affiliate of the Boston Red Sox. Completed in 1942, the stadium first hosted an affiliated minor league team in 1946, the Pawtucket Slaters, a Boston Braves farm team. In 1981, the stadium hosted the longest professional baseball game in history, as the PawSox defeated the Rochester Red Wings in 33 innings by a score of 3–2.</description>
