Notes Sunday Afternoon

- export table has some foul and fair values reversed. write a bit to select the larger of the two values to the FOP column and the smaller to Foul. 

- keep plugging on creating the polygon objects to measure. might be as simple as dropping the problem value. One of the Ironwood HS is the issue. delete it manually
    - don't forget to 

- recreate the earlier tableau viz with the new dataset

- scrape wikipedia for conferences, school enrollment.
    probably an easier source for school enrollment
        state school info database

IDEA - revisit river town map and get any data I can from Paul's point of sale system to make a cool visualization.
    all routes are basically the same
    viz ideas
        heatmap with just raw number of trips on each route
        something over the course of time
