Notes Sunday Afternoon



- recreate the earlier tableau viz with the new dataset

- scrape wikipedia for conferences, school enrollment.
    probably an easier source for school enrollment
        state school info database
    HAVE A PDF FROM MHSAA SITE, just been unable to parse it so far

    

IDEA - revisit river town map and get any data I can from Paul's point of sale system to make a cool visualization.
    all routes are basically the same
    viz ideas
        heatmap with just raw number of trips on each route
        something over the course of time
