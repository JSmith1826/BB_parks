NOTES FOR BASEBALL PROJECT

------ GOALS FOR TONIGHTS --------

DONE! - Get school info in final shape with all demo columns matched and merged
Seterate the field data by class / division and create a composite for each catagory

with school info all done start some tableau views of public vs private and simple summary plots
keep in mind that I want some simple small plots to explain the dataschool enrollment
locale breakdown, ect

STARTED - Start a new repo with the clean usable data and start to consolidate code into just a couple of books for showcase repo
	- dir structure created and clean data moved over
	- have not init repo



--- longer - use a new map visualization to make a 3d map of bars of winning percentage or total wins- look up the open source uber library


-- CREATE A CAPE COD LEAGUE MAP TO PUT ON REDDIT -
	- FIELDS ARE ALREADY PLOTTED - NEED DATA COLLECTION

-- Create a plot of the "average field" for each MHSAA class and for the tournament

-- Take a shot at creating a plot of the entire fields.
- take the kml file. create the centroid
	- create a merged polygon with complete outline of field
	- measure distance from centroid to the polygons (use 540 measurements for the outfield in current code. That would scale up to 2160 measurements.

DONE- Generate reports with the number of valid games and teams represented by each dataset
	- the only scrape that seems to be completely useless is the earliest one (2010 - only 3 teams represented)
CHECK - ADDED CLOSEST FIELD TO MHSAA INFO TABLE- Match the field info to the MHSAA School Info

- Double check the school info to make sure the table has both public and private and the matching with MHSAA data is solid


# Have the MHSAA stats seperated into regular and playoff, pretty solid looking data set
	- should be pretty easy to create charts of best regular season and post season teams for the length of the dataset
	- can pull color parameters and even paths to standardized logos from mhsaa website from the school info file

	- WAYS TO ORGATNIZE CHARTS
- split by division
- regular season wins per year / win pct per year in regular season vs postseason
- split public schools vs private schools (will require connecting to the school master info table)








-- LOnger Goals - scrape all of the avaiable tournament data from MHSAA
	- full tourney data goes back to 2011 
	- Data for tournaments before that is limited from late 90s to 2010 it is pretty standardized (text/html for QF+ and PDF of whole bracket)
	- before that semi and final data going back to 1978 is linked on website but is just pdf of the finals program that may or may not include brackets

-- Collect the HR data for each field in D1 NCAA baseball and tie it to geo data for analysis
	- could probably scrape the data from espn in a way similar to the way I did it for 2023 tourney games
		- would need to adjust game scraper to make sure it collected a good value for where the game was played
