NOTES FOR BASEBALL PROJECT

7-13-23
QUESTIONS TO ASK THE DATA ONCE IT IS IN shape	
	- What are the best weather conditions for offence and defence
	- What 

7/11/23
** NExt thing up
- get a dictionary of team names and dictionaries
- get lat lon data for all the named stadiums in the HR data
- compare the lat long data to the homeplate point of college fields to do the matching

********* Goal tonight ***
DONE - collect and organize colleg ehome run data
	- add DFs with HR data and group into locations
		- could also do summary statistics for home vs away
DONE - create summary stats of plotted college fields and compair to locations in the ESPN data

### WEATHER ###
It should be possible to add weather data for each game (worth doing for game with HR data)
	- weather undergroun or other sites have some free historical data avaiable, including wind, down to the hour or even 5 minutes
	- would also want to grab the local sunset time for each day and location in case I want to do something with it later


Have ESPN scraping done. Have all available HR data for 2023 data. 
Also have game scores with runs hits and errors going back to 2016.
	- it isn't tied to location yet but should be able to infere because of game_info column. Those are tourny name and can be assumed to be nuetral 
		- a small number of those have places in game_info descriptor

	- From those years box scores were available for some games. (All or mostly NCAA games)
		- total of about 600 games, all with locations and home run info.
			- part of that was dropping about 300 rows with valid game_ids but failed to return box score for some reason.
				- error message said a certain section was absent so the parse was aborted. those pages might have good info just in a slightly different structure
					worth checking

	- The field judging function still needs work. is only returning values up to about 5 when the range is supposed to go to ten.
		- also returns a lot of 0.0 results

	- Also want to addapt that to compare to the caculated median field instead of the constructed "ideal field" 

	- IDEA for another function:
		- summed total of the margin of each point in the series of 540 
			- can be compaired to median, min, max 
				- if all are done this would give a good summary of where it falls within the dataset
		- ALSO - split the distance columns into pieces (5 maybe even 7: down the line, left, power left, dead center, ... .. ...
			- would run the section of each field against just the same sections of the rest of the set
			

####### 7/9/23 NOTES
Create nice plots of all of the fields with the comparison calulations visable to help grasp how they are working
- work on new function that comapare each point to the med and stanard deviation. assign a value and tally then normalize into a single value or a few values (RF, CF, LF)

-- MACHiNE LEARNING ASPECT
- might be worth pertuing train a model based on home run numbers from college or pro baseball	
	- sourcing home run data for each park may be very complicated - its not practical to parse individual games with the same script I used for the NCAA sites
		- It might be possible to test scrape strategy using eson. I think all games for each from the beginning to end of season are callable




#### NOTES FOR PROCESSING THE RAW SCARPE FILES (FOOTBALL AND mbb RIGHT NOW)

GOAL - 
SET UP LAPTOP TO DO THE SCRAPING SO THE PC ISN'T TIED UP FOR HOURS AT A TIME
	- Found a better way to get game level data.

	- can get a return of every contest for a seasopn for a sport, by team, ect using MHSAA search function
		- cant make the request too large or page breaks. should keep it to 1 sport one season at a time (maybe try 2)


	- TO DO TIMESseries vizualizaations in tableau nee to keep it all in a single table	
	- PLAN
		- process the raw files into a file with summary statistics for each team each season.
		- include processing similar to baseball 
			- Pts scored H v A, Reguald v Postseason (-also looks to be some preseason data at least in basketball)
			- point diff, win pct H/A R/PC
		- save it all to a single file with acolumn for seasonYear
			- this will allow use of "parameteres' in tableau and will be able to create a single view and cycle through years




UPDATE SUNDAY 6/25
Started using new folder and repo to do statistical breakdowns of different sports
- currently scraping 10 years worth of mens basketball and football 2012-2023
- have a pretty good process that should adapt to any sports I want to use it on
- need to find a good list of all the relevent school ids for each sport. As far as I can tell all schools are in the range 3800 to 4999
	- currently checking every combination so scraping is very slow.
------ OTHER SPORTS list ----------
girls basketball (easy to mirror what I do with boys data)
hockey personal interest and will be a pretty small dataset
- golf would be interesting but the structure of the data is going to be way different	- and call for totally different analysis

- SOFTBALL - easy to mirror to boys baseeball and I could start by just scraping the list of school ids that are good for baseball	
	- a school without a baseball team is very unlikely to have softball

------ GOALS FOR TONIGHTS --------

DONE! - Get school info in final shape with all demo columns matched and merged
Seterate the field data by class / division and create a composite for each catagory

DONE! ---with school info all done start some tableau views of public vs private and simple summary plots
keep in mind that I want some simple small plots to explain the dataschool enrollment
locale breakdown, ect ---

DONE - Start a new repo with the clean usable data and start to consolidate code into just a couple of books for showcase repo
	- dir structure created and clean data moved over
	- have not init repo



--- longer - use a new map visualization to make a 3d map of bars of winning percentage or total wins- look up the open source uber library
	- new not. installed ubers open source libreary keplergl., started notebook
	- UPDATE 6/25 -  played arround with it a few nights ago
		- wasn't able to create any compelling views	
		- next time try aggrigating stas by county and see how that goes
			- big problem the first time was the map could look so barren when it just had little points and stacks at each school location



-- CREATE A CAPE COD LEAGUE MAP TO PUT ON REDDIT -
	- FIELDS ARE ALREADY PLOTTED - NEED DATA COLLECTION

-- Create a plot of the "average field" for each MHSAA class and for the tournament

---- LOTS OF WORK DONE ON THIS - SEE NEWISH NOTEBOOK - 6/22
-- Take a shot at creating a plot of the entire fields.
- take the kml file. create the centroid
	- create a merged polygon with complete outline of field
	- measure distance from centroid to the polygons (use 540 measurements for the outfield in current code. That would scale up to 2160 measurements.
----------------------------------------------------------------

DONE- Generate reports with the number of valid games and teams represented by each dataset
	- the only scrape that seems to be completely useless is the earliest one (2010 - only 3 teams represented)
CHECK - ADDED CLOSEST FIELD TO MHSAA INFO TABLE- Match the field info to the MHSAA School Info

- Double check the school info to make sure the table has both public and private and the matching with MHSAA data is solid

######## NEW NOTE 6-22 --- STILL HAVE AN ISSUE WITH 2012 - got to yearly summary loop book, special blocks in there
# Have the MHSAA stats seperated into regular and playoff, pretty solid looking data set
	- should be pretty easy to create charts of best regular season and post season teams for the length of the dataset
	- can pull color parameters and even paths to standardized logos from mhsaa website from the school info file

	- WAYS TO ORGATNIZE CHARTS
- split by division
- regular season wins per year / win pct per year in regular season vs postseason


######### NEED TO IMPORVE MATCH AND KEYS BETWEEN TABLES - CHECK MATCH QTY AND STRENGTH
- split public schools vs private schools (will require connecting to the school master info table)








-- LOnger Goals - scrape all of the avaiable tournament data from MHSAA
	- full tourney data goes back to 2011 
	- Data for tournaments before that is limited from late 90s to 2010 it is pretty standardized (text/html for QF+ and PDF of whole bracket)
	- before that semi and final data going back to 1978 is linked on website but is just pdf of the finals program that may or may not include brackets

-- Collect the HR data for each field in D1 NCAA baseball and tie it to geo data for analysis
	- could probably scrape the data from espn in a way similar to the way I did it for 2023 tourney games
		- would need to adjust game scraper to make sure it collected a good value for where the game was played
