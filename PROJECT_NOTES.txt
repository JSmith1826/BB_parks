NOTE FOR BASEBALL PROJECT

-- CREATE A CAPE COD LEAGUE MAP TO PUT ON REDDIT -
	- FIELDS ARE ALREADY PLOTTED - NEED DATA COLLECTION

- the only scrape that seems to be completely useless is the earliest one (2010 - only 3 teams represented)
- Match the field info to the MHSAA School Info

- Double check the school info to make sure the table has both public and private and the matching with MHSAA data is solid

- Generate reports with the number of valid games and teams represented by each dataset

-- LOnger Goal - scrape all of the avaiable tournament data from MHSAA
	- full tourney data goes back to 2010 and is pretty standardized (text for QF+ and PDF of whole bracket)
	- before that semi and final data going back to 1978 is linked on website but is just pdf of the finals program that may or may not include brackets

-- Collect the HR data for each field in D1 NCAA baseball and tie it to geo data for analysis
	- could probably scrape the data from espn in a way similar to the way I did it for 2023 tourney games
		- would need to adjust game scraper to make sure it collected a good value for where the game was played
	-

# Have the MHSAA stats seperated into regular and playoff, pretty solid looking data set
	- should be pretty easy to create charts of best regular season and post season teams for the length of the dataset
	- can pull color parameters and even paths to standardized logos from mhsaa website from the school info file

	- WAYS TO ORGATNIZE CHARTS
- split by division
- regular season wins per year / win pct per year in regular season vs postseason
- split public schools vs private schools (will require connecting to the school master info table)
