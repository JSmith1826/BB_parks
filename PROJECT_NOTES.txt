NOTES FOR BASEBALL PROJECT
----------------------------------


#### NOTES FOR PROCESSING THE RAW SCARPE FILES (FOOTBALL AND mbb RIGHT NOW)

GOAL - 
SET UP LAPTOP TO DO THE SCRAPING SO THE PC ISN"T TIED UP FOR HOURS AT A TIME
	- Found a better way to get game level data.

	- can get a return of every contest for a seasopn for a sport, by team, ect using MHSAA search function
		- cant make the request too large or page breaks. should keep it to 1 sport one season at a time (maybe try 2)


	- TO DO TIMESseries vizualizaations in tableau nee to keep it all in a single table	
	- PLAN
		- process the raw files into a file with summary statistics for each team each season.
		- include processing similar to baseball 
			- Pts scored H v A, Reguald v Postseason (-also looks to be some preseason data at least in basketball)
			- point diff, win pct H/A R/PC
		- save it all to a single file with acolumn for seasonYear
			- this will allow use of "parameteres' in tableau and will be able to create a single view and cycle through years




UPDATE SUNDAY 6/25
Started using new folder and repo to do statistical breakdowns of different sports
- currently scraping 10 years worth of mens basketball and football 2012-2023
- have a pretty good process that should adapt to any sports I want to use it on
- need to find a good list of all the relevent school ids for each sport. As far as I can tell all schools are in the range 3800 to 4999
	- currently checking every combination so scraping is very slow.
------ OTHER SPORTS list ----------
girls basketball (easy to mirror what I do with boys data)
hockey personal interest and will be a pretty small dataset
- golf would be interesting but the structure of the data is going to be way different	- and call for totally different analysis

- SOFTBALL - easy to mirror to boys baseeball and I could start by just scraping the list of school ids that are good for baseball	
	- a school without a baseball team is very unlikely to have softball

------ GOALS FOR TONIGHTS --------

DONE! - Get school info in final shape with all demo columns matched and merged
Seterate the field data by class / division and create a composite for each catagory

DONE! ---with school info all done start some tableau views of public vs private and simple summary plots
keep in mind that I want some simple small plots to explain the dataschool enrollment
locale breakdown, ect ---

DONE - Start a new repo with the clean usable data and start to consolidate code into just a couple of books for showcase repo
	- dir structure created and clean data moved over
	- have not init repo



--- longer - use a new map visualization to make a 3d map of bars of winning percentage or total wins- look up the open source uber library
	- new not. installed ubers open source libreary keplergl., started notebook
	- UPDATE 6/25 -  played arround with it a few nights ago
		- wasn't able to create any compelling views	
		- next time try aggrigating stas by county and see how that goes
			- big problem the first time was the map could look so barren when it just had little points and stacks at each school location



-- CREATE A CAPE COD LEAGUE MAP TO PUT ON REDDIT -
	- FIELDS ARE ALREADY PLOTTED - NEED DATA COLLECTION

-- Create a plot of the "average field" for each MHSAA class and for the tournament

---- LOTS OF WORK DONE ON THIS - SEE NEWISH NOTEBOOK - 6/22
-- Take a shot at creating a plot of the entire fields.
- take the kml file. create the centroid
	- create a merged polygon with complete outline of field
	- measure distance from centroid to the polygons (use 540 measurements for the outfield in current code. That would scale up to 2160 measurements.
----------------------------------------------------------------

DONE- Generate reports with the number of valid games and teams represented by each dataset
	- the only scrape that seems to be completely useless is the earliest one (2010 - only 3 teams represented)
CHECK - ADDED CLOSEST FIELD TO MHSAA INFO TABLE- Match the field info to the MHSAA School Info

- Double check the school info to make sure the table has both public and private and the matching with MHSAA data is solid

######## NEW NOTE 6-22 --- STILL HAVE AN ISSUE WITH 2012 - got to yearly summary loop book, special blocks in there
# Have the MHSAA stats seperated into regular and playoff, pretty solid looking data set
	- should be pretty easy to create charts of best regular season and post season teams for the length of the dataset
	- can pull color parameters and even paths to standardized logos from mhsaa website from the school info file

	- WAYS TO ORGATNIZE CHARTS
- split by division
- regular season wins per year / win pct per year in regular season vs postseason


######### NEED TO IMPORVE MATCH AND KEYS BETWEEN TABLES - CHECK MATCH QTY AND STRENGTH
- split public schools vs private schools (will require connecting to the school master info table)








-- LOnger Goals - scrape all of the avaiable tournament data from MHSAA
	- full tourney data goes back to 2011 
	- Data for tournaments before that is limited from late 90s to 2010 it is pretty standardized (text/html for QF+ and PDF of whole bracket)
	- before that semi and final data going back to 1978 is linked on website but is just pdf of the finals program that may or may not include brackets

-- Collect the HR data for each field in D1 NCAA baseball and tie it to geo data for analysis
	- could probably scrape the data from espn in a way similar to the way I did it for 2023 tourney games
		- would need to adjust game scraper to make sure it collected a good value for where the game was played
